                  would take the highest precedence.
                  ANPs with no egress rules do not affect egress traffic.

                              This is intended for representing entities that live outside the cluster,
                              which can't be selected by pods, namespaces and nodes peers, but note
                              that cluster-internal traffic will be checked against the rule as
                              well. So if you Allow or Deny traffic to `"0.0.0.0/0"`, that will allow
                              or deny all IPv4 pod-to-pod traffic as well. If you don't want that,
                              add a rule that Passes all pod traffic before the Networks rule.


                              Each item in Networks should be provided in the CIDR format and should be
                              IPv4 or IPv6, for example "10.0.0.0/8" or "fd00::/8".


                              Networks can have upto 25 CIDRs specified.

                  A total of 100 rules will be allowed in each ANP instance.
                  The relative precedence of ingress rules within a single ANP object (all of
                  which share the priority) will be determined by the order in which the rule
                  is written. Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the ingress rules
                  would take the highest precedence.
                  ANPs with no ingress rules do not affect ingress traffic.

                  A total of 100 Egress rules will be allowed in each BANP instance.
                  The relative precedence of egress rules within a single BANP object
                  will be determined by the order in which the rule is written.
                  Thus, a rule that appears at the top of the egress rules
                  would take the highest precedence.
                  BANPs with no egress rules do not affect egress traffic.

                              well. So if you Allow or Deny traffic to `"0.0.0.0/0"`, that will allow
                              or deny all IPv4 pod-to-pod traffic as well. If you don't want that,
                              add a rule that Passes all pod traffic before the Networks rule.


                              Each item in Networks should be provided in the CIDR format and should be

                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
