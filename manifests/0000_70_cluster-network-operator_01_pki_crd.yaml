        description: "OperatorPKI is a simple certificate authority. It is not intended
          for external\nuse - rather, it is internal to the network operator. The
          CNO creates a CA and\na certificate signed by that CA. The certificate has
          both ClientAuth\nand ServerAuth extended usages enabled.\n\n\tMore specifically,
          given an OperatorPKI with <name>, the CNO will manage:\n\n- A Secret called
          <name>-ca with two data keys:\n  - tls.key - the private key\n  - tls.crt
          - the CA certificate\n\n- A ConfigMap called <name>-ca with a single data
          key:\n  - cabundle.crt - the CA certificate(s)\n\n- A Secret called <name>-cert
          with two data keys:\n  - tls.key - the private key\n  - tls.crt - the certificate,
          signed by the CA\n\nThe CA certificate will have a validity of 10 years,
          rotated after 9.\nThe target certificate will have a validity of 6 months,
          rotated after 3\n\nThe CA certificate will have a CommonName of \"<namespace>_<name>-ca@<timestamp>\",
          where\n<timestamp> is the last rotation time."
